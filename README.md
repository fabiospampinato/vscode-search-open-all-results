Open all search results at once with a single command.

This extension will loop through all the available search results and open the corrispective files.

There isn't really a proper API for implementing this, therefor the way this works is a bit hacky, you might find some bugs with it. Try to use this on search queries that produce 1, or very few, results per file.

## Install

Follow the instructions in the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-search-open-all-results), or run the following in the command palette:

```shell
ext install fabiospampinato.vscode-search-open-all-results
```

## Usage

It adds 1 command, available only when the search pane is visible, to the command palette:

```js
Search: Open All Results // Open all search results at once
```

## Settings

```js
{
  "searchOpenAllResults.resultsLimit": 250, // Maximum number of results to open
  "searchOpenAllResults.fileResultsLimit": 10, // Maximum number of supported results per file
  "searchOpenAllResults.delay": 150 // Delay, in milliseconds, between file openings
}
```
